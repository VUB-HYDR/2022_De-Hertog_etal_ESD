3. evaluation_sensitivity_seas.ipynb
python notebook that takes signal seperated surface temperature and observational dataset and plots them against each other for the seasons
4. evaluation_sensitivity_seas_eflux.ipynb
python notebook that takes signal seperated energy fluxes and observational dataset and plots them against each other for the seasons
5. plot_signals_all_models.ipynb
